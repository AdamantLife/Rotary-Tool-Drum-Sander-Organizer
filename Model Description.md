### Description
[Model Notebook on GitHub](https://github.com/AdamantLife/Rotary-Tool-Drum-Sander-Organizer)

I picked up a generic barrel sanding kit for my Dremel and when it arrived the bands and mandrels were all just stuffed haphazardly into a basic plastic case. Â I decided to make these simple organizers for them.

#### Components and Assembly

My pack came with equal amounts of 1/4, 3/8, and 1/2in Sanding Bands. These nest inside each other and this model uses an 8 x 5 array of pegs to hold them. This plate is 111mm wide by 66mm deep and measures 14mm tall with the Bands in place; make sure your case can accommodate these dimensions.

The kit also came with two sets of Mandrels for mounting the Bands: a 3/32in shank set and an 1/8in shank set. This model includes two options for storing these Mandrels.

The first is a super simple strip with holes for alternating the two sizes. It is a little under 102mm long and just over 7mm wide. Given the size of the holes, the dimensional accuracy of your printer is very important for this model. Mandrels should be inserted in alternating orientation (all small Mandrels should be sticking out on one side and all large mandrels should be sticking out on the other side).

The second option uses separate holders for the Shank Sizes. It features replaceable, spring-loaded inserts to grip the shanks and is more dimensionally tolerant. The smaller holder is 74.6mm long by 14.10mm wide. The larger is 79.7mm long by 14.95mm wide. Note that the small spring-loaded holders are not compatible with the large mandrel holder and vice-versa. The spring-loaded inserts should be installed in alternating orientation like the simple model. Mandrels are pushed into the insert from the collar side (large end).

#### Printing

Most of the parts print in an obvious orientation and you can print at whatever resolution you feel comfortable with. The spring-loaded inserts specifically should be printed with their collar flat against the bed. None of the parts should be printed with supports.
